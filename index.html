       "How I taught My Grandmother to Read and Other Stories" is a collection of inspiring stories written by Sudha Murty. In these motivational stories, Sudha Murty has tried to share her own interests and values that she inherited from her elders. While reading about her childhood that she spent with her grandparents, how she affectionately taught her grandmother to read and aimed at fulfilling her grandfather's desire of keeeping their little village library well-supplied with books, one can realize the loving relationship that exists between grandparents and grandchildren. Through this storybook, we come to know about the sacrifices that doctors make, how much knowledge is important in our lives, and how we should help people without expecting anything in return. The author's way of narrating these stories inspires millions of readers and helps them to realize their dreams.
